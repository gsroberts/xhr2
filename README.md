xhr2.js
====

This project is intended to be a cross-browser, standards compliant implementation of the XmlHTTPRequest Level 2 (http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/) object in javascript, making use of native objects where possible.  Based upon the efforts of Sergey Ilinsky in xmlhttprequest.js, xhr2.js attempts to create a level 2 compliant object that can be used in place of platform or browser specific code.
